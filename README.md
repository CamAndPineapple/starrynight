# FireSky - React Hackathon Project

This web app shows you the the star visibility forecast by weighing multiple factors,
such as cloud coverage and moon illumination. It also shows the current moon phase.

My cousin, Mitchell, and I built this over a period of 48 hours at the 
[4th Annual Baltimore Hackathon](http://baltimorehackathon.com/). We had an absolute
blast scrambling to learn new technologies and slapping this together. 

I also later ported it to React-Native for use on the iphone.
