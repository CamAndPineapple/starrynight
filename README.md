# Firesky React Web

This web app shows you the the star visibility forecast by weighing multiple factors,
such as cloud coverage and moon illumination. It also shows the current moon phase.

My cousin Mitchell Deaner and I built this over a period of 48 hours at the 
[4th Annual Baltimore Hackathon](http://baltimorehackathon.com/). We had an absolute
blast scrambling to learn new technologies and piece together this app.
